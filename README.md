# recipe-app-based-on-mealdb-api

In this repo, I'm trying to build a full recipe app based on mealDB API using HTML, CSS and VanillaJs
In this project I'm trying to implement my javascript skills in order to improve them and also being able to fix bugs
The user will be able to see a main section where there is food categories and a description of each of them as well as a searching input bar where the user can type 
and get meals cards depending on alphabets that he typed, there will be also a small dropdown , by it, the user can filter meals by category (ex: pork or chicken)
After this project, I think i'm gonna learn ReactJs because it's the time for me to start with frameworks and libraries
